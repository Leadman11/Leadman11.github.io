                        <p>Chris He is an alto saxophonist, composer, arranger, educator, ML enthusiast, and back-end developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA.<br><br>

                        His vintage yet modern sound and his compositional works draw inspiration from contemporary virtuosos Kenny Garrett, Immanuel Wilkins, and Patrick Bartley.

                        During his college years at UC Berkeley, Chris was driven by his passion for music and found his niche with the UC Jazz Ensembles, a largely student-ran jazz program at the university. He would go on to serve as the program's president, and afterwards, one of its educators.

                        Chris was featured at prominent venues such as The Freight & Salvage, as well as Zellerbach Hall for TEDx Berkeley, and he has performed on various stages and events throughout the Bay Area beyond, such as Music City SF, Berkeley Art House, and Cafe Cotton Club in Tokyo.

                        Chris has studied under Dann Zinn, Myra Melford, Frank Martin, and Ted Moore. He has also shared the stage with Mat Muntz, Nicole McCabe, and Marty Ehrlich.</p>
